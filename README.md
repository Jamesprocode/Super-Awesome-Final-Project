# Software Design Document: Super Awesome Final Project (MUSI 6106)

**Author(s):** Angela Branchek, Rafael Collado, Binyue Deng, JD Harris, Jiayi Wang

## Canvas assignment bullet points
- motivation, problem to be solved, why is there a need for this
- applications, use cases, target users, context, environment
- functionality from user point of view and how it differentiates from similar products
- plans for implementation: flow chart, processing blocks, needed components, potential need for 3rd party libs
- algorithmic references - which reference do you base your algorithmic implementations on?
- general responsibilities and work assignments (can overlap)
- (Bonus) If you can create a timeline and make use of the Github Projects functionality

## Filled-in Version
- We want to take the guesswork out of long plugin chains for [INSERT HERE: vocals, guitar, etc??] and provide producers a sleek, straightforward plugin with only one or two knobs to effortlessly improve a track's sound. By orchestrating multiple effects in tandem with a single knob, we can help users get to a sound they love faster and easier.
- This plugin is useful for anyone, from novice producers looking for a fool-proof way to level up their sound, to commerical audio engineers who want a quick and reliable way to get their work done without sacrificing quality.
- Our plugin will do the heavy lifting in the background for the user, making sure the interface is as fool-proof as possible.
- We will be developing this product as a VST plugin. We will have to research and iterate on the underlying chain and how our knob(s) affect the sound.
- We are partially inspired by plugins like Fresh Air and the OneKnob series, who offer minimal user interfaces with impressive output quality.
- general responsibilities and work assignments (can overlap) [INSERT HERE]
- (Bonus) If you can create a timeline and make use of the Github Projects functionality [i don't care about this tbh]
